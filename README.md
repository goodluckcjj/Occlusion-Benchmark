# Occlusion Benchmark
This is the code for our proposed benchmark, which aims at evaluating the robustness of tracking algorithms to occlusion.

The dataset is available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qZ0KeoW. 

The 'Evaluation' folder contains the code for evaluating tracking algorithms on our occlusion benchmark.

Based on CODT, we proposed Adaptive CODT. This code is the implementation of it. 

The code also contains several tracking algorithms that are re-implemented by us, including KCF, DSST, SAMF, Staple. These tracking algorithms act as the baseline trackers for adaptive CODT.
